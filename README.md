# About The Project:

In this project, you’ll build a form the old fashioned way and then the Rails way.

# Built With:

Ruby On Rails.

# Getting Started With The Project:

1. Build a new rails app (called “re-former”).

2. Go into the folder and create a new git repo there. Check in and commit the initial stuff.

3. Modify your README file to say something you’ll remember later, like “This is part of the Forms 
Project in The Odin Project’s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com”

4. Create and migrate a User model with :username, :email and :password.

5. Add validations for presence to each field in the model.

6. Create the :users resource in your routes file so requests actually have somewhere to go. Use the :only option to specify just the :new and :create actions.

7. Build a new UsersController (either manually or via the $ rails generate controller Users generator).

8. Write empty methods for #new and #create in your UsersController.

9. Create your #new view in app/views/users/new.html.erb.

10. Fire up a rails server in another tab.

11. Make sure everything works by visiting http://localhost:3000/users/new in the browser.

# What Was Learnt During The Project:

We got the chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides.
